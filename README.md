# kaggle-titanic

Code for [my attempts](https://www.kaggle.com/hodapp) at the
[House Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/leaderboard) beginner competition on Kaggle.

So far this contains:

- A `shell.nix` to set up a Python environment
- A Jupyter notebook for loading the data and doing some exploratory
  analysis
